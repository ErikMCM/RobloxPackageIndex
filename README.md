# Roblox Package Index

## Information
More information to this project can be found at the [Wiki](https://github.com/ErikMCM/RobloxPackageIndex/wiki) (https://github.com/ErikMCM/RobloxPackageIndex/wiki)

## Branch Contents
This branch is used for the actual plugin code.

Please don't tell me that the branches are being used incorrectly, I know they should be used for different versions or projects going to main, but this is how RPI will be set up as I don't want anyone to get in trouble for using unpermitted offsite links on Roblox, or people bring afraid that a webpage would be malicious. Sorry I care more about people feeling safe, than having pretty and perfect webpage and setup. Thanks.
